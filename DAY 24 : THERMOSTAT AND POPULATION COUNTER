//Problem 1: Thermostat Controller : The first task was to design a controller for a thermostat. A **thermostat** is a device that regulates the temperature of a system by switching heating or cooling devices on or off as needed. In this scenario, the thermostat controls both a heater (for winter) and an air conditioner (for summer).

module top_module (
    input too_cold,
    input too_hot,
    input mode,
    input fan_on,
    output heater,
    output aircon,
    output fan
); 
    
    assign heater = mode && too_cold;
    assign aircon = ~mode && too_hot;
    assign fan = fan_on || heater || aircon ;
    
endmodule


//A "population count" circuit counts the number of '1's in an input vector. Build a population count circuit for a 3-bit input vector.

module top_module( 
    input [2:0] in,
    output [1:0] out );

    assign out = in[0] +in[1] + in[2];
    
endmodule
