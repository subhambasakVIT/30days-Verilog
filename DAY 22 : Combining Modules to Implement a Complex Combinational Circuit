// Yestrday I created two modules A and B today we create a combinational circuit with them.Today, I dove deep into the realm of combinational circuits by combining two previously created modules. The circuit we worked on today is a complex design that involves two instantiations each of subcircuits A and B. By connecting these modules and utilizing logic gates, we were able to generate a final output z.

module top_module (input x, input y, output z);

    wire t1,t2,t3,t4,t5,t6;
    A a1(x,y,t1);
    B b1(x,y,t2);
    A a2(x,y,t3);
    B b2(x,y,t4);
    or(t5,t1,t2);
    and(t6,t3,t4);
    xor(z,t5,t6);
    
endmodule

module A (input x, input y, output z);

    assign z = (x^y) & x;
    
endmodule

module B ( input x, input y, output z );

    assign z = (~x & ~y) | (x & y);
    
endmodule
